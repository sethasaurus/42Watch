# 42Watch
An open source smartwatch.

This repository will contain PCB designs, code,
3D designs for components for a smartwatch.

The aim is to create something that will load and
run Pebble watchfaces and apps. Hopefully we can
come up with something that will run PebbleOS,
RebbleOS, and/or an OS that is built specifically
for the 42Watch.

Please join the discussion to share any ideas
on hardware options: <a href="https://github.com/sethasaurus/42Watch/discussions/2">here</a>
