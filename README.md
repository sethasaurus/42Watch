# 42Watch
An open source smartwatch.

This repository will contain PCB designs, code, 3D designs for components
for a smartwatch.

The aim is to create something that will load and run Pebble watchfaces and apps.
Hopefully we can come up with something that will run PebbleOS, RebbleOS, and/or
an OS that is built specifically for the 42Watch.
